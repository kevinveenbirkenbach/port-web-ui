```

This will install the CLI tool, making it available system-wide.

## YAML Configuration Guide üîß

The portfolio is powered by a YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`). This file allows you to define the structure and content of your site, including cards, navigation, and company details.

### YAML Configuration Example üìÑ

```yaml
accounts:
  name: Online Accounts
  description: Discover my online presence.
  icon:
    class: fa-solid fa-users
  children:
    - name: Channels
      description: Platforms where I share content.
      icon:
        class: fas fa-newspaper
      children:
        - name: Microblogs
          description: Stay updated with my microblog posts.
          icon:
            class: fa-solid fa-pen-nib
          children:
            - name: Mastodon
              description: Follow my updates on Mastodon.

### Understanding the `children` Key üîç

The `children` key allows hierarchical nesting of elements. Each child can itself have children, enabling the creation of multi-level navigation menus or grouped content.

### Understanding the `link` Key üîó

The `link` key allows you to reference another part of the YAML configuration by its path, which helps avoid duplication and maintain consistency.

## Deployment üö¢

For production deployment, ensure to:

- Use a reverse proxy like NGINX or Apache.
- Secure your site with SSL/TLS.
- Use a production-ready database if required.
