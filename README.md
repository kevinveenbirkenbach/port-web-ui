## Getting Started üèÅ

### Prerequisites üìã

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Python and YAML for configuration.

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Update the configuration:**
   Create a `config.yaml` file. You can use `config.sample.yaml` as an example (see below for details on the configuration).

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access your portfolio:** Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Configuration Guide üîß

The portfolio is powered by a YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`). This file allows you to define the structure and content of your site, including cards, navigation, and company details.

### YAML Configuration Example üìÑ

```yaml
accounts:
  name: Online Accounts
  description: Discover my online presence.
  icon:
    class: fa-solid fa-users
  children:
    - name: Channels
      description: Platforms where I share content.
      icon:
        class: fas fa-newspaper
      children:
        - name: Microblogs
          description: Stay updated with my microblog posts.
          icon:
            class: fa-solid fa-pen-nib
          children:
            - name: Mastodon
              description: Follow my updates on Mastodon.
              icon:
                class: fa-brands fa-mastodon
              url: https://microblog.veen.world/@kevinveenbirkenbach

### Understanding the `children` Key üîç

The `children` key allows hierarchical nesting of elements. Each child can itself have children, enabling the creation of multi-level navigation menus or grouped content. Example:

```yaml
children:
  - name: Parent Item
    description: Parent description.
    icon:
      class: fa-solid fa-folder
    children:
      - name: Child Item
        description: Child description.
        icon:
          class: fa-solid fa-file
        url: https://example.com
```

This structure will render a parent menu or section containing nested child elements. Each child can be further customized with icons, descriptions, and links.

### Understanding the `link` Key üîó

The `link` key allows you to reference another part of the YAML configuration by its path. This is useful for avoiding duplication and maintaining consistency. Example:

```yaml
children:
  - name: Blog
    description: My blog posts.
    icon:
      class: fa-solid fa-blog
    url: https://example.com/blog
  - name: Featured Blog
    link: accounts.children[0].children[0]  # References the "Blog" item above
```

In this example, `Featured Blog` will inherit all properties from the `Blog` item, including its name, description, and URL. This feature ensures that any updates to the `Blog` item are automatically reflected in all linked entries.
