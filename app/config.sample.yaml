            #### Why Use PGP?
            PGP ensures your email content stays private, protecting against surveillance, data breaches, and unauthorized access.

            #### Protect Your Privacy
            In an age of mass data collection, PGP empowers you to communicate securely and assert control over your information. For insights on protecting your digital rights, visit the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/).

            #### Build Trust
            Encrypting emails demonstrates a commitment to privacy and security, fostering trust in professional and personal communication.

            #### Stand for Security
            Using PGP is more than a tool—it's a statement about valuing freedom, privacy, and the security of digital communication. Explore the principles of secure communication with [privacy guides](https://privacyguides.org/).
